# Methods

## Water Temperature Data

The water temperature data was obtained from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) using a buoy located off the eastern coast of Dauphin Island. This buoy collects data at regular intervals, generally 30-minutes long, but certain months were at 6-minute intervals. To standardize the data for analysis, only measurements taken at the top of each hour (3:00, 4:00, 5:00, etc.) were retained.

The time period of this data spanned from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The original data was split up into three smaller datasets, one for each year, but was aggregated into a single dataset containing 20,334 records. Next, the time-related fields (Year, Month, Day, Hour, and Minute) were combined into a Timestamp variable so that they could be used for visualization, though this variable wasn't used in our modeling. Following this, missing values were analyzed and dealt with. Only 2.84% of Timestamps lacked corresponding water temperature measurement. Since that percentage was minimal compared to the size of our dataset, those records were dropped. This workflow is visualized in Figure 2.

After the initial preprocessing, irrelevant features were removed from the data. Only three features were retained for the statistical modeling: Year, Month, and Water Temperature. The independent variables were Year and Month, while the dependent variable in our analysis was Water Temperature. Originally measured in degrees Celsius, the water temperature data was converted to degrees Fahrenheit to align with the operational threshold relevant to the research question.

## Energy Data

The energy data was collected by Southern Company, the largest energy utility company in the Southeastern United States, but sourced from the U.S. Energy Administration (EIA). The EIA verified and cleaned up Southern Company's original data, and subsequently made it available to the public. The EIA's dataset contained 364 records with no missing values. The time period for this data spans from March 1, 2024 to February 27, 2025, with measurements taken once per day. Originally, the intent was to analyze more than a year's worth of data, but the EIA only allowed for a year's worth.

Similar to the water temperature dataset, unnecessary features were removed from this dataset, keeping only the Timestamp and Energy Demand. The Timestamp feature was later separated into individual time components, but only the Month feature was kept to identify monthly demand patterns. Since there was only data for a single year, the Year feature provided no additional insight. The other important feature, Energy Demand, was the dependent variable. For the purposes of this analysis, Demand is defined as the amount of electricity load within Southern Company's electric system, measured in megawatt-hours (MWh).

## Statistical Analyses

All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.3.1 [@rcoreteamProjectStatisticalComputing2023] and the tidyverse package version 2.0.0 [@wickhamWelcomeTidyverse2019]. First, a simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed, visualizing trends and using base R functions such as `summary()`, `sd()`, `max()`, and `min()` to establish baseline statistics.

Following this phase, both the water temperature data and energy data were fitted on standard linear models using the `lm()` function in R. For the water model, the goal was to project future water temperatures and their probabilities. On the contrary, for the energy model the primary interest was in the significance of the overall F statistic. If this was significant, examining monthly averages would give solid insight into periods with high energy demand.
