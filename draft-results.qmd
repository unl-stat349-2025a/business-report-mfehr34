## Data {.unnumbered}

The Water Temperature data comes from 3 different datasets, one for each year (2022, 2023, 2024). To create the dataset used for analysis, these 3 separate datasets were first combined into one dataset with 20,334 records. Then, Month and Year fields were extracted from the Timestamp variable so that they could be used separately for analysis. Finally, missing values were considered and dealt with. Only 2.84% of Timestamps didn't have a corresponding water temperature measurement. Since that percentage was very low, those rows were dropped. This workflow is visualized here:

As previously mentioned, water temperature values were measured in degrees Celsius, but converted to Fahrenheit for ease of use. The mean water temperature was 72.64 degrees Fahrenheit with a standard deviation of 11.84 degrees. The minimum water temperature is 46.22 degrees Fahrenheit and the maximum is 95.36 degrees Fahrenheit. In Figure 1, the trend and periodic changes of water temperature over time are visualized. The maximum occurred on April 6, 2022. The minimum occurred on January 22, 2022; January 23, 2022; and January 22, 2024.

Preparing the Energy data was much more straightforward. The data had 364 records with no missing values. The data contains measurements from March 1, 2024 to February 27, 2025. The only significant transformation was extracting Month and Year fields from the provided Timestamp field.

The values in the electricity demand field were measured in Megawatt-Hours (MWh). The mean demand was 658,977 MWh with a standard deviation 105,189 MWh. The minimum demand was 489,834 MWh observed on April 13, 2024. The maximum demand was 990,613 MWh observed on January 1, 2025. In Figure 2, the trend of electrical demand over time is visualized. The overall trend and main effects are harder to pick out than for water temperature.

## Analysis {.unnumbered}

After exploring the descriptive statistics, a standard linear model was fitted to the Water Temperature data with the year and month fields as inputs and the water temperature as the output. Year was treated as a numeric variable, while month was treated as a factor. The F-statistic for the model was 12,200 (p-value \< 2e-16). The main effects for each month and year were all statistically significant with each having a p-value less than 2e-16. The main effect with the largest estimate was July with a value of 31.12. The main effect with the smallest estimate was the Year with a value of 0.40. The Adjusted R-squared value was 0.88 suggesting a good fit.

The next step was to predict the next 5 years of water temperatures using the fitted model. The predictions are visualized in Figure 3. 18 months over the next five years were predicted to have water temperatures above 85 degrees Fahrenheit, entirely composed of the June, July, August, and September months. 17 out of 18 of those months have a 99% chance or greater to be above the threshold according to this model.

The secondary analysis was examining the electrical demand over the past year, specifically looking at the months that were found to have a predicted water temperature exceeding the threshold. These months (June, July, August, September) are when the plant is predicted to operate at reduced capacity, limiting the amount of energy output. A standard linear model was fit to the energy data with the input as the factor Month and the output as electricity demand. The model had an F-statistic of 66.26 (p-value \< 2e-16). Every main effect for the month was significant except for May and September with p-values greater than 0.53. The adjusted R-squared for the model was 0.66 suggesting a moderate fit. Finally, electrical demand by month was predicted and is visualized in Figure 4. The shaded blue regions are the months predicted to be at reduced operating capacity, the main Months considered.
